// FILE NAME : README            
// PROGRAM PURPOSE :                                           
//  The purpose of this program is to do matrix multiplication
// on two matrices input through a input file. 
// -----------------------------------------------------------

Answer 1:
 My programs logic is that an input file containing the dim-
ensions and data of two matrices is read in. After reading and
saving the matrices the program creates the channels needed for
talking to the threads down and to the right. Each thread reciev-
es the numbers from above and left, does its multiplication and
saves the answers until reading end of data.

Answer 2:
 This program works by reading in the dimensions and data from
an input file using stdin. From there the data is used to create
threads with channels that allow communication with the threads 
below and to the right. Each thread used the channels to recieve 
numbers above and left so they can be multiplied and sent to its
neibors (continuing right and down) in return. Threads complete
and can exit once they recieve the end of data flag from its up
and left neighbors.

Answer 4:
 a:

 b: Synchronous is used instead of Asynchronous because if we used
 asynchronnmous there would be no way to protect threads from being
overwritten by other threads. By using syncronous we can wait to send
our data to ensure data being read isn't overwrote prematurely.
