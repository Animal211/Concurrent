1.Are there any race conditions in this prefix sum computation? 
Why?


2.Prove rigorously that this algorithm does compute the prefix 
sum correctly.


3.Can the result of x[i]+x[i-2h-1] of run h be saved back to x[i]?
Explain your findings as clearly as possible.


4.The main() creates n threads in each iteration and wait for them to complete.
There is a significant amount of time in creating and joining threads.
If you are allowed to use extra variables/arrays and busy waiting,
can you just create n threads and let them do all the work without the use of a
temporary array B[*,*]? Suggest a solution and discuss its correctness.
