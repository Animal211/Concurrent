1.How do you guarantee that only three elves will ask questions?

     For each elf to ask a question it first waits on the semaphore 
"queue" which starts with 3. After the first three elves go in the
only time it signals is after santa answers the question and the 
elves go back to work when santa signals the queue 3 times for the
next group.
 

2.Show that why no elf will leave before the questions are answered.
Each elf while in the queue for issues calls wait on the semaphore
"Answer" which is signaled by santa after answering their questions.
This ensures the threads are held until the question is answered.


3.Show that while three elves are waiting for an answer, no other 
elves can cut in and ask questions.
Once the first three elves enter the queue each following elf still 
calls Wait on Queue. The queue inside the semaphore will keep the 
order of the subsequent wait calls and allow in only the next sub-
sequent waiting elves once santa signals 3 times.


4.How do you guarantee that Santa only answers question while he is 
not sleeping.
There is a sleeping semaphore that is waited on which is only Signaled
after the 3rd elf or the last reindeer returns. This gurenteers Santa
doesnt answer questions while sleeping.


5.Show that when Santa is wakened up by a reindeer, this reindeer is
 the last one coming back from vacation.
The method waitothers keeps a running tally of the reindeer back from
vacation which it compares to the total number of reindeer each call.
If they are qual then it must be the last reindeer and that reindeer 
sends a signal to santa.


6.How do you make sure Santa always handles reindeers first.
In the sleep method there is an if else statment that decides if it
was elves or reindeer that woke santa up. The if statment calls the 
sleep method which checks first if the reindeer count is equal to the
total number of reindeer, if it is it returns 1 and that is handled.
If there arent all the reindeer it then checks the queue to help the 
elves.


7.Show that while Santa is attaching the sleigh and delivering toys, 
all reindeers are there. They won't sneak out for vacation.
After waiting for all the reindeer each reindeer waits on the sleigh.
Once the sleigh is there each reindeer signals when they are attached
and then call flyoff which makes each reindeer wait on the "delivering"
semaphore to make sure they do not leave during delivery nad only when
santa releases them.

8.Show that while Santa is attaching the sleigh and delivering toys,
elves will not ask questions.
While out delivering presents elves can still have issues but they
will only be put in the queue semaphores queue. They then wait there
until santa gets back from delivering. When santa gets back if he
hasn't retired then he answers their questions.
